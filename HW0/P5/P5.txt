1) Need to do 255 summations - 255 seconds

2) Yes, the 8 of them can split the bags evenly and find the sum of their respective 32 bags which would take 31 seconds. 4 of them then take the sums of the other 4 people and sum their numbers together (1 second), then 2 take the sum of the other 2 (1 second), then 1 person takes the final sum (1 second). So in total 34 seconds + whatever time it takes to communicate the sums between employees.

3) Using the same process of adding numbers, then taking half the employees to add the remaining numbers...
	128 employees sum 2 numbers - 1 second
	64 employees sum 2 numbers - 1 second
	...
	1 employee sums 2 numbers

	For a total of 8 seconds

4) log_2(N) seconds.

5) Add a second every time there's a sum between two numbers except in the first case - 15 seconds

6) Add 256 seconds, 1 second for every cashier coming to get 1 bag from you - 271 seconds
   Add 128 seconds, 1 second for every cashier coming to get 2 bags from you - 143 seconds

   Try to parallelize the distribution of bags as much as possible:

   Give 256 bags to Emp1 - 1 second
   Emp1 gives 128 bags to Emp2 - 1 second
   Emp1-2 give 64 bags simultaneously to Emp3/Emp4 - 1 second
   Emp1-4 give 32 bags simultaneously to Emp5-8 - 1 second
   ...
   Emp1-64 give 2 bags simultaneously to Emp65-128 - 1 second
   Give your 2 bags to Emp65 - 1 second

   Altogether distribution is 9 seconds + 15 seconds of calculation = 24 seconds
